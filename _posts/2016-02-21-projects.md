## Plot

The film is [aparodyof][0] the historical spectacular[film genre][1][anthology][2], including the[sword and sandal][3]epic and the[period costume drama][4]subgenres. The four main segments consist of stories set during the Stone Age, the[Roman Empire][5], the[Spanish Inquisition][6], and the[French Revolution][7]. Other intermediate skits include reenactments of the giving of the[Ten Commandments][8]and the[Last Supper][9].

Moses ([Mel Brooks][10]) is shown coming down from[Mount Sinai][11]carrying three stone tablets after receiving the Law from God (the voice of an uncredited[Carl Reiner][12]). When announcing the giving of the reception of the law to the people, Moses proclaims, "The Lord Jehovah has given unto you these fifteen..." (whereupon he drops one of the tablets, which promptly shatters) "[Oy][13]... ten!_[TEN Commandments][8]_! For all to obey!"

# The Roman Empire

Comicus (Brooks again), a stand-up philosopher, is notified by his agent[Swiftus][14]([Ron Carey][15]) that he has landed a gig at Caesar's palace. En route to the palace Comicus meets and falls in love with a[Vestal Virgin][16]named Miriam ([Mary-Margaret Humes][17]) and befriends an[Ethiopian][18]slave named Josephus ([Gregory Hines][19]). Josephus' life is spared when he is[conscripted][20]into the service of the Empress Nympho ([Madeline Kahn][21]). In ancient Roman culture, Miriam could have freed Josephus just by touching him, because she was a vestal virgin. Comicus' arrival at Caesar's palace was filmed at the[Caesars Palace][22]hotel in[Las Vegas][23].

At the Palace, Emperor[Nero][24]([Dom DeLuise][25]) gorges on food, ogles pretty maidens and waits to be entertained. Comicus forgets his audience and begins to crack insulting one-liners about the emperor's[abundant body contours][26]and[corrupt ways][27]. Josephus absentmindedly pours a jug of wine into Nero's lap and is ordered to fight Comicus to the death in a[gladiatorial][28]manner. They fight their way out of the palace, assisted in their escape by Miriam, Empress Nympho and a horse named Miracle.

After Miriam helps Comicus, Josephus and Swiftus briefly find refuge in Empress Nympho's home, Josephus is "outed" among a row of[eunuchs][29]after "[reacting][30]" to a seductive dancer's performance, and the group is chased by Roman soldiers led by Marcus Vindictus ([Shecky Greene][31]). As the soldiers gain on the group's cart (pulled by Miracle), Josephus instructs them to pull over in a field and requests lots of[papyrus][32]. He takes "Roman Red"[marijuana][33]which is growing alongside the road and rolls it into the papyrus, forming a device he calls Mighty[Joint][34], sets fire to it and mounts it to the back of their chariot, trailing smoke into the chasing army.

De Monet manages to convince the king that the revolution is building and he needs to go into hiding, so they will need a stand-in to pretend to be him. Thus Jacques (also Brooks), the_gar√ßon de pisse_(a.k.a. "piss-boy"), is chosen to impersonate the real king. Later that night, MlleRimbaud, unaware of the subterfuge, arrives and offers herself to the piss-boy who is dressed as the king. As she invites him to take her[virginity][35], he pardons her father without requiring the sexual favors. After MlleRimbaud and her[senile][36]father ([Spike Milligan][37]) return from the prison, the peasants burst into the room and capture the piss-boy "king" and MlleRimbaud. They are taken to the guillotine for the crimes committed by the crown. When asked if he would like a blindfold or any last words, Jacques declines. However, when they test the guillotine, Jacques make a final request for Novocain. The executioner declares "there is no such thing known to medical science", to which Jacques replies "I'll wait". Just as Jacques is about to be beheaded MlleRimbaud muses that "only a miracle can save him now", and Josephus arrives in a cart pulled by Miracle, the horse from the film's Roman Empire segment. They all escape Paris, riding away in the cart. The last shot is of the party approaching a mountain carved with the words "THE END."
